1 a) The sum of an infinite geometric series is t/(1-r). In this case t = 1 and r = 1/3. Therefore the sum is 1/(1-1/3) = 1/(2/3) = 3/2 = 1.5

b) The sum of a geometric series is ar^k = a(1-r^n)/(1-r^n). In this case a is 1, r is 5, and n is N. However i starts at 4 so I need to subtract a=1;r=5;n=4 from it.
So the answer is a(1-5^n)/(1-5^n) - a(1-5^4)/(1-5^4) = 5/4(5^n = 125)

c) Sum of i^3 + 9i - 2 = Sum of i^3 + 9 * sum of i + sum of -2. The general formula for sum of x^k is S(k,i)(n+1 choose i+1)i!. 
When the formula is applied the sum comes out to (1/4)*(N^2+N)^2 + (9/2)N(N+1) + (-2)(N+1) = 1/4 (N+1) (N^3+N^2+18N-8)

d) To change bases for a logs, the formula is logb(x) = logd(x)/logd(b). So log5(i) = log10(i)/log10(5). The summation of log(x) = log(n!)
The summation of log5(i) = log((10^N))!/log(5). = log5((10^N)!) 


2 a) This simplifies to x^(sum of (n) starting from n=1 to n=N). Therefore the solution is x^(N(N+1)/2) 

b) logn(n^6) =  6. 

c)ã€€n^(logn(x)) = x. 17^(log17(280)) = 280.

d) first break it into 2 parts. ln(x) where x = ln(e^e^N). First solve for x. x = e^N. ln(x) = ln(e^N) = N.

3 a) 10P3 = 10!/(10-3)! = 10*9*8 = 720

b) 39C4 = 39!/(4!(39-4)!) = 82251
